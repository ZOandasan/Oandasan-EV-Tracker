        <h1>About The EV Tracker</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>All Pokemon have a base Stat total that increases as a Pokemon levels up. This is affected by a pokemon's nature, adding a positive and negative modifier to the growth of a random stat. Sometimes this overlaps to a net neutral benefit, however this is automatically calculated. Once a pokemon reaches level 100, their stats can't increase any more , can they?</p>
        <p>This is incorrect due to Effort Values. Effort Values shortened to EVs, can add extra stats to a pokemon beyond what they would get through leveling alone. This is the primary reason trainer pokemon are considered stronger then their wild pokemon counterparts.</p>
        <p>Pokemon are limited to 510 EVs in total, and limited to 252 EVs per stat. Every four EV's gained in a stat raises the stat by one stat point at level 100. This in turn means that if you dont take advantage of EV's you are losing out on 127 stat points at level 100, and up to 63 stat points in a given stat.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>How do you get EVs?</h3>
        <p>There are two common methods: Items and Battling.</p>
        <p>There are a number of Stat boosting items that are generally called Vitamins. Each one raises a stat by 10 EV's up to a maximum of 100 EVs per stat. This could theoretically be used to raise a pokemon to full EVs assuming you want a well rounded pokemon. </p>
        <p>EVs however are powerful because you can consolidate these extra stats onto two stats. This is why the most common method of getting EV's is through battle. Each species of pokemon will drop a guarenteed number and value of EV. As an example, a squirtle of any level will be guarenteed to drop exactly 1 Def EV. If you Knock Out 252 squirtle with your Bulbasaur, it now has 252 Def EVs, and 63 extra defense at level 100.</p>
        <p>There are items that can speed up the process, such as the Macho Brace which doubles the rate at which the pokemon holding the item gains EVs. There are also pokemon who drop more than one EV. Normally Evolved pokemon drop more EVs than their unevolved counterparts.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>How do I know which stats will make my pokemon the strongest?</h3>
        <p>The best practice is to look at the pokemon's stats and move pool when you capture them. Since EV training is a lengthy process, only do it on pokemon you know you want to keep, and have a complementary nature to their primary stats. You don't want an Abra with a nature that boosts its Attack and lowers its Speed. Make use to check before investing the time. Capture or Breed until you have a pokemon with the correct nature.</p>
        <p>Once you have a pokemon you know you want to EV train, you want to figure out what stats you want to prioritize. For heavy damage dealing pokemon, focus their primary attack stat and their speed. For more defensive pokemon increase the HP, Def, and sp. Def stats. Figure out which pokemon drop the desired stats, and which routes include these pokemon.</p>
        <p>Finally, equip a Macho Brace if you have one, and begin killing. Areas that have two pokemon spawning is ideal, and all hit moves are fantastic. As an Example, if you are farming for Def EVs in a Sinnoh Game, have the pokemon learn either Surf or Earthquake and partner with Riley in the iron Islands. You will be able to knock out two Steelix, Onyx, and/or Graveler per move.</p>
        <p>Also Make sure that you keep track of the EVs you gain. It's a time consuming process and you will not want to mess up counting.</p>

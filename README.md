# Oandasan EV Tracker

### Site Functionality
I wanted to create a site where people could track the pokemon in their pokemon games, showing the pokemon that you have caught and a way to track the growth of the pokemon. This is primarily through the user tracking the EVs that a given pokemon has gained, but also noting its nature, and its level.

To accomplish this, I used the pokemon API to grab the existing data the pokemon company has. This allows me to  show all the pokemon in the national dex, as well as provide accurate pokemon species, types, abilities, movesets, and sprites.
